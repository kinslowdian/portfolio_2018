				<h3>Tuborg Open</h3>
				<p class="font-light">On the digital side of new business pitch for Tuborg, I was involved in bringing a concept for a social app to life through design and a video animation created in After Effects to demo the product. The intention was to make the app look as real as possible, including all the little details like interaction, swiping, selecting images, and a fully flowing messenger window for the chatbot section.</p><p class="font-light">This video was modified later after the pitch to help sell in a chatbot idea that eventually went into production and released in Eastern Europe. Along with a version that was populated in content for the Asian markets such as China for possible use there. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Bruno Banani Opening Lines</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Following the awful dates theme from the previous social posts in 2016, Opening Lines took the dating theme further than the previous, with awkward texts sent by each of the characters. Focusing on lots of facial expressions within a split screen concept to show the shock and dismay the crazy hopefuls inflict at the same time. The production agency in charge of filming, supplied lots of footage, allowing freedom for choice of cuts and editing within the film.</p><p class="font-light">The project started with a rough animated storyboard using ungraded footage to get the concept approved by the client, to then go into full production for what would go live on social channels. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator, Animate, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Prince’s Trust #partofPT</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To mark the 40th anniversary of the prince's trust, an online hub was created for those involved to share their memories and experiences to highlight the size of the trust. The campaign was powered by the Twitter platform hashtag’d to link users video and images into galleries for others to share and add. </p><p class="font-light">My role as a lead designer on the project, involved creating designs that had a clear hierarchy, creation of extra modules and UI that matched the parent site, and were within restraints of technical requirements. Making sure information and instructions in all pages were presented within the design clearly for a wide user age group. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Barilla Global Platform</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With many operations across the world, the websites lacked consistency with each region. TMW Unlimited was asked to come up with a global solution for markets to use. The team adopted a user centered design approach, identifying various personas and their requirements. The design of modules were heavily reviewed and tested throughout. </p><p class="font-light">I was involved in many sprint sessions throughout the project, working closely with UX and Development to be sure our ideas and solutions were possible. Getting an insight into what websites appealed to the client, the initial creative process started with forming three style tiles, to present three possible design routes using that inspiration to get very close to the vision Barilla had in their minds sooner within a very big project. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator. HTML / CSS for presentations during sprints.</p>

				<h3>thebar.com Editorial Version</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Diageo wanted some options with thebar.com to promote various products at various seasonal points in the year. A proposal to look at making the landing page more editorial was requested, pushing more than one article or link within the header, followed by further drink mixing content below within the rest of the page.</p><p class="font-light">A second part to the project was to look at a new section within the site in the form of a hub of articles, that could be used as a blog. With a purpose of highlighting drink events, seasonal cocktails, recipes, and highlight various diageo products. A freeier approach was adopted with these layout compared to the more structured look and feel of thebar.com. Sadly none of these concepts came to light other than the split header on the current website. Nevertheless, It was a fun exercise in layout experiments. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Ofgem, be an energy shopper</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With Ofgem bringing in changes to simplify the energy market, TMW were tasked with creating an online hub of information for the public about these and future changes planned. With a user age range of 18-80 meant ease of use was mandatory across all pages. Colours were contrast checked throughout the design process to cater for as many as possible at AA standard. </p><p class="font-light">A friendly vibe was incorporated into the design with strong use of colour, and SVG Icons that sat with their relative article to avoid lots of FAQ like templates. I worked as a Lead designer and Illustrator throughout the project, working closely with development and UX at many stages. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Sure DO:MORE</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To push the DO:MORE branding of Sure deodorant, TMW covered POS, social, ECRM, print, and a TV ad with this campaign. Focusing on summer festival tickets achieved through competition codes. My first task involved the creation of the online hub and keeping a premium, easy to use style from the landing page, all the way through to the submit form. </p><p class="font-light">I was heavily involved in the creative for online advertising after the hub design. To target as possible, the accompanying media was built both in Flash and the Celtra ad platform to allow rich animation on mobile and tablet devices using html / css. Altogether the campaign achieved 39% ad recognition and one million social impressions. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and Celtra.</p>

				<h3>Infiniti Website Relaunch</h3>
				<p class="font-light">While the Infiniti.com website was being built for Europe, TMW were asked to create a brand hub to fill the gap in between and overhaul the current site used for the region. Design, UX and development worked closely within a small team over a period of a few months to be seamless in creating the site. </p><p class="font-light">A key requirement was to present the user with information that was considered yet organised, and to avoid being text heavy. Focusing on full bleed imagery to highlight the premium products Infiniti were creating. Clear navigation, easy on the eye, and a strategy to simplify the user journey and to increase user engagement to eventually submitting their information for a possible test drive. User base for the site increased by 26% compared to the previous hub. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Sony Data Capture</h3>
				<p class="font-light">This project involved looking at refreshing sony’s current data capture forms for customer contact details to registration for a new account on their website. Looking at the original UX, I did my best to keep the form clear and sectioned neatly with grouping and clear titles. Giving adequate spacing for error messages and general breathing space between the various blocks of data fields. As with any online project, mobile users were considered from the start.

				<h3>A Forest of Wormholes</h3>
				<p class="font-light">After countless experiments with Actionscript and a few large online projects, I never got the chance to make a game because of the focus moving away from Flash over to HTML5 at the time. With my time spent learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript I decided back in 2013 this would be the perfect time to push my skills in developing a game for an experiment. Gameplay involves navigating through the portals to progress to further levels, eventually having to defeat enemies through battles involving paper / rock / scissors. </p><p class="font-light">Part maze, part adventure, and my attempt at an RPG was good experience in further learning web development away from Flash. My only regret with the project, relying on jQuery for the whole build, maybe one day I’ll rewrite this project to run smoother on today’s modern browsers. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator. HTML, CSS, JSON, and Javascript.</p>

				<h3>Weathered Gifs</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Over the years learning javascript, I’ve played around with a few experiments online using various weather api’s. LIke any designer that uses Slack, I couldn’t help but be wowed by the infinite amount of gifs on GIPHY, there to be used for quick replies to work colleagues. Soon my love for Giphy extended when I discovered they have an api to collect random gifs based on a search term. So with that in mind, I developed a quick idea for the browser to be a very retro weather tv screen, showing a few details about the local weather, displaying a full screen gif as a background to match the current weather, along with a few css tricks like interlacing the screen.</p><p class="font-light">With the build working identically on mobile, Weathered Gifs could be used as an alternate weather update to what is usually on iOS and Android. Applications and skills used during the project: HTML, CSS, JSON, Javascript, GIPHY api, and Weather Underground api.</p>

				<h3>Oh Shiiiiit</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Following some research for a dropped work project involving a potential travel update display, I took the knowledge I gained from the TFL api to create a very rude travel update for the London underground network. Working in London as a commuter, I know my frustrations with train companies, and hear the same level of frustrations from users of the underground network.</p><p class="font-light">So when something goes wrong, this project will give an alternative update, using colourful language we say quietly in our minds or out loud when we miss that appointment, that all important meeting, or just simply getting into work late.
I have some plans to extend this project further, and possibly some other projects using the similar data available.  Applications and skills used during the project: HTML, CSS, JSON, Javascript, and the TFL api.

				<h3>The Hungry Monkey Clock</h3>
				<p class="font-light">In the past I had seen many graphical clocks online, built in either Flash or HTML5. I looked into an idea for one that was interactive. In past to keep an old watch or antique clock running, the user would have to wind the mechanism. I decided to create a clock that required feeding to display the time correctly. </p><p class="font-light">Pressing the monkey’s nose would ensure a steady stream of bananas, supplying them energy to wake them up. As each monkey falls asleep the scene gradually forms into night with a gentle transition. Instructions are also supplied in a novel way to be sure the clock works as desired. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator. HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

				<h3>Broken Image Link Mario</h3>
				<p class="font-light">One day  while using Safari, I noticed the icon used for missing images was very close to the item blocks in just about all the Nintendo Mario games. For a bit of fun I worked out the pixel grid of the famous mario sprite, and then rendered this within the page using javascript. Gradually with a delay, each block would run a basic css transition, changing the broken link into the correct pixel colour. </p><p class="font-light">When finally complete the sprite would explode randomly in a mass of colour blocks. Tapping any one of these will rebuild the sprite, rewinding the effect. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop. HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
