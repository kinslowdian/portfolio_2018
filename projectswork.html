				<h3>Which? World Cup</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With an expected rise of entertainment purchases during the world cup, which wanted to highlight their product reviews and comparisons available to subscribers through online ads. I worked on these using some of the previous designed and animated icons, but giving them a little hint of the football theme that the current set style would allow. After a few tests with various ball illustrations, colour combination, animation styles I could then start creating and building these into the banner templates.</p><p class="font-light">To really give the ball clairity, a white fill was added later in the development, and probably the only icon in the whole set to use this colour method, against the other dark filled with red highlights on details colour combination. Applications and skills used during the project: Javascript, Illustrator, and Animate.</p>

				<h3>Tuborg Open</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To highlight a new track created by Diplo and MØ espcially for Tuborg, I created a suite of social video posts for each of their social accounts, mainly intended for Instagram. Asset wise, a promotional video was available to us, along with extra behind the scenes footage. I used a glitchy text treatment, to help be consistent with what the production agency had used on some of their promotional video.</p><p class="font-light">This aided hard cuts within the videos to be more visually interesting. The main priority with these was the vertical video posts, later resized to the more familiar square format. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator, and After Effects.</p>

Brand awareness came in the form of the clockman logo, bulging in over the video as a sign off at the end.</p><p class="font-light">Time Remapping was a valuable tool creating these, helping especially with the looping versions.

The new look used very bold colours and simple icon graphics alongside bold impactful text. With the many services Which? has to offer to consumers led to the opportunity to develop new ones.</p><p class="font-light">While creating these new icons, I could consider how they would animated and come to life at the same time, making the production of the creation and animation almost seamless.

More traditional methods followed with the social video suite to producing online banners, and an example for a production company to follow.</p><p class="font-light">The turnaround time was very tight due to releasing this mix of social and digital advertising at the same time the TV ad went live.

				<h3>M&S Food, Christmas 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">One of the most impressive social videos out of the suite I produced for the M&S Christmas food campaign was the parallax scene over a table full of Christmas food, showing the range of food M&S were promoting for the festive season. The items themselves were cut out from campaign photography and comped together in After Effects, while careful animation and control of the camera on the timeline was refined to create a fly through over the table scene, showing a main product at the end before cutting to the logo.</p><p class="font-light">The posts were targeting mobile social users, and the vertical video especially presented a few challenges in keeping a nice view of the scene within a narrow width window.

The previous emails that were being used at the time were over hauled with this fresher cleaner look. The suite contained a total seven emails, so a semi modular design was used to keep a sense of consistency across the set.</p><p class="font-light">Like the banner ads created previous to this, the creative followed the new communication style with bold colour and dark icon artwork using the famous question mark.

The intention was to make the app look as real as possible, including all the little details like interaction, swiping, selecting images, and a fully flowing messenger window for the chatbot section.</p><p class="font-light">This video was modified later after the pitch to help sell in a chatbot idea that eventually went into production and released in Eastern Europe.

At the time Facebook had just started accepting the vertical video format to make more use of mobile displays. Our creative took this as the primary size to begin all our video creatives.</p><p class="font-light">The concept of these quick teasers is a split screen view of the food alongside a mediterranean theme or scenery that the food range took influence from with colours and tastes.

				<h3>Infiniti Website Relaunch</h3>
				<p class="font-light">While the Infiniti.com website was being built for Europe, TMW were asked to create a brand hub to fill the gap in between and overhaul the current site used for the region. Design, UX and development worked closely within a small team over a period of a few months to be seamless in creating the site. </p><p class="font-light">A key requirement was to present the user with information that was considered yet organised, and to avoid being text heavy. Focusing on full bleed imagery to highlight the premium products Infiniti were creating. Clear navigation, easy on the eye, and a strategy to simplify the user journey and to increase user engagement to eventually submitting their information for a possible test drive. User base for the site increased by 26% compared to the previous hub. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>BBC iPlayer</h3>
				<p class="font-light">This brief was part of a pitch within the BBC, over methods on how to monetise parts of the iPlayer outside the UK for oversea customers, similar to subscription services and iTunes. Taking the strategy and user journey on how this could be a possibility, my task involved bringing this to life within the design of program landing pages on the main BBC website, while working closely with an Art Director and UX. </p><p class="font-light">I had to balance usability and cosmetics to keep a page looking rich and appealing with full bleed backgrounds, while being easy to use for multiple personas. Keeping the BBC brand and careful consideration to UI and CTA’s. A strong focus on designing for tablet use was a requirement throughout. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Diageo, thebar.com</h3>
				<p class="font-light">The first brief I started on when joining TMW soon became the biggest too. Diageo’s theBar.com at the time existed only in the US as a cocktail recipe site. A release planned for Europe allowed an opportunity to redesign, and rethink the entire user journey completely, from page layout right down to the UI. Working with an Art Director, and UX helped to keep the balance of a premium yet usable site. </p><p class="font-light">Brand awareness was in union alongside clearly presented cocktail recipes and never overpowering. After launch results were impressive too, 300,000 average visits a month, with 50% of traffic from portable devices, and over 100 social shares a week.

To push that message further came in the form of a book that existed in various rich media placements. Artwork and illustrations from the campaign were all included to give a sketch book aesthetic to the overall design. Page turning of the book was refined and tested to keep the experience as rich and realistic as I could. </p><p class="font-light">Along with a system that loaded in the pages dynamically to help filesize restraints with the media space. Different languages were also required for the campaign to run in Europe too. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash. Developed in actionScript 3.0.</p>

				<p class="font-light">In the run up to the Olympics in 2012,  adidas wanted to release  a new line of Stella McCartney designed sportswear. To create interest and provide information to potential customers about these new products, an idea was formed to create a microsite from scratch that lived inside adidas.com. </p><p class="font-light">Featuring a one page site solution and having control over the UX, I decided on accordions and tabs to house the relative sections. With access to rich photography provided by adidas, made the process of achieving a premium look and feel much easier. A small team involving myself, a producer, a developer, and an account manager had complete ownership of the project throughout.

				<h3>Nokia N9</h3>
				<p class="font-light">For the release of Nokia’s N9 glue Isobar had presented a concept and idea around an AR website using the webcam api in Flash to interact with the phone using gestures. Here users could get an insight into the latest UI of the phone and see all other features and benefits with the product. After experimenting with the handset I went on to design and direct a style that matched the bold colours of the handset and take hints of the UI on the phone’s OS. </p><p class="font-light">CTA’s were treated more like hotspots than buttons, and required a different approach to other microsites previously designed. I supported the Flash developers during the build stage, supplying assets and animating sequences and screens in After Effects. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and After Effects.</p>

Using video from various parts of the microsite I comped everything into a flow with cue points to trigger certain titling and text effects. Every aspect of the ad right down to small little UI hints, were designed and animated with as much detail as possible.</p><p class="font-light">File size restrictions on collapsed parts of the placement meant animating a lot of the effects on the side of the shoe with the basic tools in Flash than using sequences or loops of video.

Working with an illustrator to vectorise just about everything, I had the task of designing and animating the concept compressing everything as much as I could, but still keeping a premium feel to the whole piece.</p><p class="font-light">I had to rely completely on an actionscript tween library to control all the animation, and to minimize file size with avoiding lengthy timelines. Clickthrough rates were higher than the original targets, and the ad itself became an example as to how the agency could push standard ads for future and prospecting clients.
