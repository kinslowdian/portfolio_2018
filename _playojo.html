				<h3>Which? Online Advertising</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With a new brand look devised and created for print by Grey, I was tasked with getting this new look and feel working within the digital space for the likes of social, online advertising, and digital outdoor spaces. The new look used very bold colours and simple icon graphics alongside bold impactful text. With the many services Which? has to offer to consumers led to the opportunity to develop new ones.</p><p class="font-light">While creating these new icons, I could consider how they would animated and come to life at the same time, making the production of the creation and animation almost seamless. Applications and skills used during the project: Javascript, Illustrator, and Animate.</p>

				<h3>Which? World Cup</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With an expected rise of entertainment purchases during the world cup, which wanted to highlight their product reviews and comparisons available to subscribers through online ads. I worked on these using some of the previous designed and animated icons, but giving them a little hint of the football theme that the current set style would allow. After a few tests with various ball illustrations, colour combination, animation styles I could then start creating and building these into the banner templates.</p><p class="font-light">To really give the ball clairity, a white fill was added later in the development, and probably the only icon in the whole set to use this colour method, against the other dark filled with red highlights on details colour combination. Applications and skills used during the project: Javascript, Illustrator, and Animate.</p>

				<h3>M&S Food, Christmas 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">One of the most impressive social videos out of the suite I produced for the M&S Christmas food campaign was the parallax scene over a table full of Christmas food, showing the range of food M&S were promoting for the festive season. The items themselves were cut out from campaign photography and comped together in After Effects, while careful animation and control of the camera on the timeline was refined to create a fly through over the table scene, showing a main product at the end before cutting to the logo.</p><p class="font-light">The posts were targeting mobile social users, and the vertical video especially presented a few challenges in keeping a nice view of the scene within a narrow width window. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>M&S Christmas 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With the M&S tie up with the release of Paddington 2 for their Christmas ad, there was a push on social to get the Christmas campaign across all social channels. Involving short bumpers, boomerangs using footage from the main TV ad. More traditional methods followed with the social video suite to producing online banners, and an example for a production company to follow.</p><p class="font-light">The turnaround time was very tight due to releasing this mix of social and digital advertising at the same time the TV ad went live. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Tuborg Open To More</h3>
				<p class="font-light">A suite of social posts were created to be released alongside Grey’s first TV ad for Tuborg. With extra footage of all the characters that made an appearance in the ad, short cuts were made from these for social use. Brand awareness came in the form of the clockman logo, bulging in over the video as a sign off at the end.</p><p class="font-light">Time Remapping was a valuable tool creating these, helping especially with the looping versions. Other editing skills with masking allowed alternative methods of revealing text within the creative suite. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Virgin Trains, Arrive Awesome</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To push more ticket sales, the Arrive Awesome campaign covered TV, press, outdoor, social, and digital advertising. Online the campaign resulted in 25 million online impressions, and the campaign on a whole increased revenue by £13.5 million. With my experience in Flash advertising, this was to be my first introduction to HTML banners on the build side. </p><p class="font-light">It was an immense challenge in getting everything to run correctly across multiple devices and multiple browsers, and to match the storyboards exactly. Workarounds and solutions were aplenty, and solving issues was very satisfying. I learnt a great deal about javascript development from this project, while working within the development team, and thankfully have never relied on jQuery again! Applications and skills used during the project: HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.</p>

				<h3>Bruno Banani Opening Lines</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Following the awful dates theme from the previous social posts in 2016, Opening Lines took the dating theme further than the previous, with awkward texts sent by each of the characters. Focusing on lots of facial expressions within a split screen concept to show the shock and dismay the crazy hopefuls inflict at the same time. The production agency in charge of filming, supplied lots of footage, allowing freedom for choice of cuts and editing within the film.</p><p class="font-light">The project started with a rough animated storyboard using ungraded footage to get the concept approved by the client, to then go into full production for what would go live on social channels.

				<h3>M&S Food, Summer 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To coincide with the TV and print advertising for the M&S summer food campaign, I helped produce a suite of assets for social videos. At the time Facebook had just started accepting the vertical video format to make more use of mobile displays. Our creative took this as the primary size to begin all our video creatives.</p><p class="font-light">The concept of these quick teasers is a split screen view of the food alongside a mediterranean theme or scenery that the food range took influence from with colours and tastes. To complete the body of work, various banner placements were designed keeping the same idea across both the social and online advertising. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Animate, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>M&S Summer 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Promoting the summer range was the first Marks and Spencer project I was involved in after Grey won the account. The main focus was on various video placements for outdoor media across the country, the media ran on screens in places such as train stations, shopping centers and similar. The creatives all followed the new creative branding set out for the Spend It Well campaign run by Grey.</p><p class="font-light">Many different versions had to be created due to many media specifications and screen sizes, it was quite a challenge to keep the whole creative package consistent, relying on a layout grid more than ever for all video layouts.
