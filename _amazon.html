				<h3>M&S Food, Summer 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To coincide with the TV and print advertising for the M&S summer food campaign, I helped produce a suite of assets for social videos. At the time Facebook had just started accepting the vertical video format to make more use of mobile displays. Our creative took this as the primary size to begin all our video creatives.</p><p class="font-light">The concept of these quick teasers is a split screen view of the food alongside a mediterranean theme or scenery that the food range took influence from with colours and tastes. To complete the body of work, various banner placements were designed keeping the same idea across both the social and online advertising. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Animate, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Tuborg Open To More</h3>
				<p class="font-light">A suite of social posts were created to be released alongside Grey’s first TV ad for Tuborg. With extra footage of all the characters that made an appearance in the ad, short cuts were made from these for social use. Brand awareness came in the form of the clockman logo, bulging in over the video as a sign off at the end.</p><p class="font-light">Time Remapping was a valuable tool creating these, helping especially with the looping versions. Other editing skills with masking allowed alternative methods of revealing text within the creative suite. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>M&S Summer 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Promoting the summer range was the first Marks and Spencer project I was involved in after Grey won the account. The main focus was on various video placements for outdoor media across the country, the media ran on screens in places such as train stations, shopping centers and similar. The creatives all followed the new creative branding set out for the Spend It Well campaign run by Grey.</p><p class="font-light">Many different versions had to be created due to many media specifications and screen sizes, it was quite a challenge to keep the whole creative package consistent, relying on a layout grid more than ever for all video layouts. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Which? World Cup</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With an expected rise of entertainment purchases during the world cup, which wanted to highlight their product reviews and comparisons available to subscribers through online ads. I worked on these using some of the previous designed and animated icons, but giving them a little hint of the football theme that the current set style would allow. After a few tests with various ball illustrations, colour combination, animation styles I could then start creating and building these into the banner templates.</p><p class="font-light">To really give the ball clairity, a white fill was added later in the development, and probably the only icon in the whole set to use this colour method, against the other dark filled with red highlights on details colour combination. Applications and skills used during the project: Javascript, Illustrator, and Animate.</p>

				<h3>M&S Christmas 2017</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With the M&S tie up with the release of Paddington 2 for their Christmas ad, there was a push on social to get the Christmas campaign across all social channels. Involving short bumpers, boomerangs using footage from the main TV ad. More traditional methods followed with the social video suite to producing online banners, and an example for a production company to follow.</p><p class="font-light">The turnaround time was very tight due to releasing this mix of social and digital advertising at the same time the TV ad went live.

				<h3>Bruno Banani Opening Lines</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Following the awful dates theme from the previous social posts in 2016, Opening Lines took the dating theme further than the previous, with awkward texts sent by each of the characters. Focusing on lots of facial expressions within a split screen concept to show the shock and dismay the crazy hopefuls inflict at the same time. The production agency in charge of filming, supplied lots of footage, allowing freedom for choice of cuts and editing within the film.</p><p class="font-light">The project started with a rough animated storyboard using ungraded footage to get the concept approved by the client, to then go into full production for what would go live on social channels.

				<h3>M&S Back To School</h3>
				<p class="font-light">After the two summer campaigns for food and clothing, the next big one was for the Back To School Range. This creative for a Facebook carousel took some patience with masking out the kids to reveal the various offers M&S wanted to promote during peak uniform buying periods. The intense masking and jumping frame by frame for some of the footage, this project was certainly a labour of love. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and After Effects.</p>

				<h3>Barilla Global Platform</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With many operations across the world, the websites lacked consistency with each region. TMW Unlimited was asked to come up with a global solution for markets to use. The team adopted a user centered design approach, identifying various personas and their requirements. The design of modules were heavily reviewed and tested throughout. </p><p class="font-light">I was involved in many sprint sessions throughout the project, working closely with UX and Development to be sure our ideas and solutions were possible. Getting an insight into what websites appealed to the client, the initial creative process started with forming three style tiles, to present three possible design routes using that inspiration to get very close to the vision Barilla had in their minds sooner within a very big project. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator. HTML / CSS for presentations during sprints.</p>

				<h3>Christmas Tracker</h3>
				<p class="font-light">For the leadup to Christmas in 2014, I worked with another designer and developer at TMW on a side project to track Christmas terms used on twitter. Starting off with a list of words / terms we illustrated many characters and objects best to suit those and then housed them within a scene that zoomed when the user scrolled. To keep everything crisp and sharp our creations were exported as SVG. </p><p class="font-light">The project took around three weeks to produce outside of work, just in time for a launch at the start of december, using Google Drive to share and collaborate with assets. An option to kindly donate to the charity Shelter was also added. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>thebar.com Editorial Version</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Diageo wanted some options with thebar.com to promote various products at various seasonal points in the year. A proposal to look at making the landing page more editorial was requested, pushing more than one article or link within the header, followed by further drink mixing content below within the rest of the page.</p><p class="font-light">A second part to the project was to look at a new section within the site in the form of a hub of articles, that could be used as a blog. With a purpose of highlighting drink events, seasonal cocktails, recipes, and highlight various diageo products. A freeier approach was adopted with these layout compared to the more structured look and feel of thebar.com. Sadly none of these concepts came to light other than the split header on the current website. Nevertheless, It was a fun exercise in layout experiments. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Ofgem, be an energy shopper</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With Ofgem bringing in changes to simplify the energy market, TMW were tasked with creating an online hub of information for the public about these and future changes planned. With a user age range of 18-80 meant ease of use was mandatory across all pages. Colours were contrast checked throughout the design process to cater for as many as possible at AA standard. </p><p class="font-light">A friendly vibe was incorporated into the design with strong use of colour, and SVG Icons that sat with their relative article to avoid lots of FAQ like templates. I worked as a Lead designer and Illustrator throughout the project, working closely with development and UX at many stages.

				<h3>Sure DO:MORE</h3>
				<p class="font-light">To push the DO:MORE branding of Sure deodorant, TMW covered POS, social, ECRM, print, and a TV ad with this campaign. Focusing on summer festival tickets achieved through competition codes. My first task involved the creation of the online hub and keeping a premium, easy to use style from the landing page, all the way through to the submit form. </p><p class="font-light">I was heavily involved in the creative for online advertising after the hub design. To target as possible, the accompanying media was built both in Flash and the Celtra ad platform to allow rich animation on mobile and tablet devices using html / css. Altogether the campaign achieved 39% ad recognition and one million social impressions. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and Celtra.</p>

				<h3>A Forest of Wormholes</h3>
				<p class="font-light">After countless experiments with Actionscript and a few large online projects, I never got the chance to make a game because of the focus moving away from Flash over to HTML5 at the time. With my time spent learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript I decided back in 2013 this would be the perfect time to push my skills in developing a game for an experiment. Gameplay involves navigating through the portals to progress to further levels, eventually having to defeat enemies through battles involving paper / rock / scissors. </p><p class="font-light">Part maze, part adventure, and my attempt at an RPG was good experience in further learning web development away from Flash. My only regret with the project, relying on jQuery for the whole build, maybe one day I’ll rewrite this project to run smoother on today’s modern browsers.

				<h3>The Hungry Monkey Clock</h3>
				<p class="font-light">In the past I had seen many graphical clocks online, built in either Flash or HTML5. I looked into an idea for one that was interactive. In past to keep an old watch or antique clock running, the user would have to wind the mechanism. I decided to create a clock that required feeding to display the time correctly. </p><p class="font-light">Pressing the monkey’s nose would ensure a steady stream of bananas, supplying them energy to wake them up. As each monkey falls asleep the scene gradually forms into night with a gentle transition. Instructions are also supplied in a novel way to be sure the clock works as desired.

				<h3>Broken Image Link Mario</h3>
				<p class="font-light">One day  while using Safari, I noticed the icon used for missing images was very close to the item blocks in just about all the Nintendo Mario games. For a bit of fun I worked out the pixel grid of the famous mario sprite, and then rendered this within the page using javascript. Gradually with a delay, each block would run a basic css transition, changing the broken link into the correct pixel colour. </p><p class="font-light">When finally complete the sprite would explode randomly in a mass of colour blocks. Tapping any one of these will rebuild the sprite, rewinding the effect. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop. HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

				<h3>Weathered Gifs</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Over the years learning javascript, I’ve played around with a few experiments online using various weather api’s. LIke any designer that uses Slack, I couldn’t help but be wowed by the infinite amount of gifs on GIPHY, there to be used for quick replies to work colleagues. Soon my love for Giphy extended when I discovered they have an api to collect random gifs based on a search term. So with that in mind, I developed a quick idea for the browser to be a very retro weather tv screen, showing a few details about the local weather, displaying a full screen gif as a background to match the current weather, along with a few css tricks like interlacing the screen.</p><p class="font-light">With the build working identically on mobile, Weathered Gifs could be used as an alternate weather update to what is usually on iOS and Android. Applications and skills used during the project: HTML, CSS, JSON, Javascript, GIPHY api, and Weather Underground api.</p>
