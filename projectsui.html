				<h3>Which? Black Friday Emails</h3>
				<p class="font-light">For the Black Friday period of 2017, Which? saw an opportunity to release a suite of emails sent to their subscribers to cover various questions and pointers of getting the best out of the sales. The previous emails that were being used at the time were over hauled with this fresher cleaner look. The suite contained a total seven emails, so a semi modular design was used to keep a sense of consistency across the set.</p><p class="font-light">Like the banner ads created previous to this, the creative followed the new communication style with bold colour and dark icon artwork using the famous question mark. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

				<h3>Tuborg Open</h3>
				<p class="font-light">On the digital side of new business pitch for Tuborg, I was involved in bringing a concept for a social app to life through design and a video animation created in After Effects to demo the product. The intention was to make the app look as real as possible, including all the little details like interaction, swiping, selecting images, and a fully flowing messenger window for the chatbot section.</p><p class="font-light">This video was modified later after the pitch to help sell in a chatbot idea that eventually went into production and released in Eastern Europe. Along with a version that was populated in content for the Asian markets such as China for possible use there.

The campaign was powered by the Twitter platform hashtag’d to link users video and images into galleries for others to share and add. </p><p class="font-light">My role as a lead designer on the project, involved creating designs that had a clear hierarchy, creation of extra modules and UI that matched the parent site, and were within restraints of technical requirements. Making sure information and instructions in all pages were presented within the design clearly for a wide user age group.

				<h3>Barilla Global Platform</h3>
				<p class="font-light">With many operations across the world, the websites lacked consistency with each region. TMW Unlimited was asked to come up with a global solution for markets to use. The team adopted a user centered design approach, identifying various personas and their requirements. The design of modules were heavily reviewed and tested throughout. </p><p class="font-light">I was involved in many sprint sessions throughout the project, working closely with UX and Development to be sure our ideas and solutions were possible. Getting an insight into what websites appealed to the client, the initial creative process started with forming three style tiles, to present three possible design routes using that inspiration to get very close to the vision Barilla had in their minds sooner within a very big project. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator. HTML / CSS for presentations during sprints.</p>

The focus for the initial creation used campaign material planned for the summer of 2015. </p><p class="font-light">I was tasked with the UX and design on this brief, to form reviewed wireframes after discussions with the client over various requirements. I worked closely with development after to be sure my solution would work within the backend of the site and the browsers the parent site targeted and how to present the campaign clearly for mobile users.

				<p class="font-light">This project involved looking at refreshing sony’s current data capture forms for customer contact details to registration for a new account on their website. Looking at the original UX, I did my best to keep the form clear and sectioned neatly with grouping and clear titles. Giving adequate spacing for error messages and general breathing space between the various blocks of data fields. As with any online project, mobile users were considered from the start.

				<h3>thebar.com Editorial Version</h3>
				<p class="font-light">Diageo wanted some options with thebar.com to promote various products at various seasonal points in the year. A proposal to look at making the landing page more editorial was requested, pushing more than one article or link within the header, followed by further drink mixing content below within the rest of the page.</p><p class="font-light">A second part to the project was to look at a new section within the site in the form of a hub of articles, that could be used as a blog. With a purpose of highlighting drink events, seasonal cocktails, recipes, and highlight various diageo products. A freeier approach was adopted with these layout compared to the more structured look and feel of thebar.com. Sadly none of these concepts came to light other than the split header on the current website. Nevertheless, It was a fun exercise in layout experiments. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

With a user age range of 18-80 meant ease of use was mandatory across all pages. Colours were contrast checked throughout the design process to cater for as many as possible at AA standard. </p><p class="font-light">A friendly vibe was incorporated into the design with strong use of colour, and SVG Icons that sat with their relative article to avoid lots of FAQ like templates. I worked as a Lead designer and Illustrator throughout the project, working closely with development and UX at many stages.

Focusing on summer festival tickets achieved through competition codes. My first task involved the creation of the online hub and keeping a premium, easy to use style from the landing page, all the way through to the submit form. </p><p class="font-light">I was heavily involved in the creative for online advertising after the hub design. To target as possible, the accompanying media was built both in Flash and the Celtra ad platform to allow rich animation on mobile and tablet devices using html / css. Altogether the campaign achieved 39% ad recognition and one million social impressions. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and Celtra.</p>

				<h3>Infiniti Website Relaunch</h3>
				<p class="font-light">While the Infiniti.com website was being built for Europe, TMW were asked to create a brand hub to fill the gap in between and overhaul the current site used for the region. Design, UX and development worked closely within a small team over a period of a few months to be seamless in creating the site. </p><p class="font-light">A key requirement was to present the user with information that was considered yet organised, and to avoid being text heavy. Focusing on full bleed imagery to highlight the premium products Infiniti were creating. Clear navigation, easy on the eye, and a strategy to simplify the user journey and to increase user engagement to eventually submitting their information for a possible test drive. User base for the site increased by 26% compared to the previous hub. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

Taking the strategy and user journey on how this could be a possibility, my task involved bringing this to life within the design of program landing pages on the main BBC website, while working closely with an Art Director and UX. </p><p class="font-light">I had to balance usability and cosmetics to keep a page looking rich and appealing with full bleed backgrounds, while being easy to use for multiple personas. Keeping the BBC brand and careful consideration to UI and CTA’s. A strong focus on designing for tablet use was a requirement throughout.

A release planned for Europe allowed an opportunity to redesign, and rethink the entire user journey completely, from page layout right down to the UI. Working with an Art Director, and UX helped to keep the balance of a premium yet usable site. </p><p class="font-light">Brand awareness was in union alongside clearly presented cocktail recipes and never overpowering.

To create interest and provide information to potential customers about these new products, an idea was formed to create a microsite from scratch that lived inside adidas.com. </p><p class="font-light">Featuring a one page site solution and having control over the UX, I decided on accordions and tabs to house the relative sections. With access to rich photography provided by adidas, made the process of achieving a premium look and feel much easier.

				<p class="font-light">For the release of Nokia’s N9 glue Isobar had presented a concept and idea around an AR website using the webcam api in Flash to interact with the phone using gestures. Here users could get an insight into the latest UI of the phone and see all other features and benefits with the product. After experimenting with the handset I went on to design and direct a style that matched the bold colours of the handset and take hints of the UI on the phone’s OS. </p><p class="font-light">CTA’s were treated more like hotspots than buttons, and required a different approach to other microsites previously designed. I supported the Flash developers during the build stage, supplying assets and animating sequences and screens in After Effects.
